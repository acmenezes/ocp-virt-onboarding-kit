Excellent question! This gets to the core of how cloud networking fundamentally differs from physical/bare-metal environments. Let me explain why even having a second physical NIC in the same subnet range won't work for localnet topology in cloud environments.

## **Cloud Networking Restrictions**

### **1. No True L2 Bridging**
Even with a "second physical NIC," cloud providers don't allow true Layer 2 bridging:

```bash
# This won't work in cloud environments:
# Pod/VM → OVS Bridge → Physical NIC → Cloud Network
```

**Why it fails:**
- Cloud instances are isolated at the hypervisor level
- No broadcast/multicast forwarding between instances
- ARP requests don't traverse between instances

### **2. MAC Address Restrictions**
Cloud providers enforce strict MAC address policies:

```yaml
# Localnet tries to use pod/VM MAC addresses directly
# But cloud providers only allow:
- Instance's original MAC address
- Pre-registered MAC addresses (if supported)
- Anti-spoofing prevents foreign MAC addresses
```

### **3. Security Group Enforcement**
Even with same subnet ranges, cloud firewalls block traffic:

```bash
# Traffic flow that gets blocked:
Pod (192.168.1.10) → eth1 (192.168.1.5) → Cloud Network → Another Instance
#                     ↑
#                Security groups drop packets with
#                unregistered source IPs/MACs
```

## **Specific Cloud Provider Examples**

### **AWS VPC Limitations**
```bash
# AWS doesn't allow:
- L2 adjacency between instances
- MAC address changes on ENIs
- IP forwarding without source/destination checks disabled
- Broadcast/multicast traffic between instances
```

### **Azure Virtual Networks**
```bash
# Azure blocks:
- Custom MAC addresses on NICs
- IP forwarding between VMs without UDR (User Defined Routes)
- ARP requests between VMs in different availability zones
```

## **Why Same Subnet Range Still Fails**

Even if your second NIC is in `192.168.1.0/24` and your pods are also in `192.168.1.0/24`:

### **1. No ARP Resolution**
```bash
# Pod tries to reach 192.168.1.100
# Sends ARP: "Who has 192.168.1.100?"
# Cloud hypervisor drops ARP broadcast
# Pod never gets ARP reply → communication fails
```

### **2. Instance Isolation**
```bash
# Cloud provider enforces:
Instance A (192.168.1.5) ← → Cloud Router ← → Instance B (192.168.1.10)
                          ↑
                    All traffic must route through
                    cloud infrastructure, not direct L2
```

### **3. Anti-Spoofing Protection**
```bash
# When pod sends packet:
Source: 192.168.1.20 (pod IP)
Egress Interface: eth1 (192.168.1.5)

# Cloud provider sees:
# "Instance with IP 192.168.1.5 is sending traffic with source 192.168.1.20"
# Anti-spoofing: DROP PACKET
```

## **Technical Deep Dive**


## **The Core Issue: Multiple Layers of Virtualization**

Your question hits on a fundamental misunderstanding about cloud networking. Even with a second physical NIC in the same subnet range, the traffic still can't pass because of **multiple layers of network virtualization** that cloud providers implement.

## **Why Same Subnet Range Still Fails**

### **1. Anti-Spoofing at the Hypervisor Level**
```bash
# Your pod sends a packet:
Source IP: 192.168.1.20 (pod)
Egress Interface: eth1 (192.168.1.5 - instance IP)

# Cloud hypervisor sees this and thinks:
# "Instance 192.168.1.5 is trying to send traffic with source 192.168.1.20"
# "This looks like IP spoofing - DROP THE PACKET"
```

### **2. No True L2 Adjacency**
Even if both your instance and destination are in `192.168.1.0/24`:
```bash
# What you expect:
Pod (192.168.1.20) → eth1 → L2 switch → Destination (192.168.1.30)

# What actually happens:
Pod (192.168.1.20) → eth1 → Hypervisor → Cloud Router → Destination
                             ↑
                    Blocks L2 traffic, forces L3 routing
```

### **3. MAC Address Enforcement**
```bash
# Your pod/VM will try to use its own MAC address
# But cloud providers only allow:
- The instance's original MAC address
- Pre-registered secondary MAC addresses (if supported)

# Any other MAC addresses are dropped at the hypervisor level
```

## **Real-World Example**

Let's say you have:
- **Instance A**: `192.168.1.5` with second NIC `eth1`
- **Pod on Instance A**: `192.168.1.20`  
- **Instance B**: `192.168.1.10`

When the pod tries to communicate with Instance B:

1. **Pod generates packet**: `src=192.168.1.20, dst=192.168.1.10`
2. **Packet hits eth1**: Instance tries to forward it
3. **Hypervisor inspection**: "192.168.1.5 instance sending packet with source 192.168.1.20?"
4. **Anti-spoofing triggers**: Packet dropped before it even leaves the instance
5. **No ARP resolution**: Even if packet passed, ARP wouldn't work between instances

## **The Solution: Embrace the Cloud Model**

This is exactly why the overlay configurations I created use **Geneve encapsulation**:

```bash
# Overlay approach (works in cloud):
Pod (10.200.1.20) → OVN → Geneve tunnel → Instance IP (192.168.1.5) → Cloud Network
      ↑                                            ↑
Internal overlay IP                    Cloud sees normal instance traffic
```

The cloud provider sees normal traffic between instance IPs (`192.168.1.5` ↔ `192.168.1.10`), while the overlay network handles the pod-to-pod communication internally.

This is why cloud-native networking embraces **overlay networks** - they work **with** cloud restrictions rather than fighting against them.
